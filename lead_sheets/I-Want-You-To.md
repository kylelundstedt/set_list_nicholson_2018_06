# I-Want-You-To


### Intro  2x

### Verse  16x
The moon was shining on the lake at night  
The Slayer t-shirt fit the scene just right  
Thru smeared mascara, I looked into your eyes and saw a light

You told me stories about your chickadees  
They didn't like B-B guns or stupid archery  
You charmed the lifeguard, he let them use the pool all day for free

Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at my feet  
I was next to you and you were right there next to me … And I said

### Chorus  (short) 8x
Girl!
If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)  
So make a move (Make ur movvvvve)  
'cause I ain't got all night

### Verse  16x
The rest of the summer was the best we ever had  
We watched Titanic, & it didn't make us sad  
I took you to Best Buy, You took me home to meet ur Mom & Dad

Your Mom cooked meatloaf even though I don't eat meat  
I dug you so much, I took some for the team  
Your dad was silent, his eyes were fixed on what was on TV  

### Pre-chorus  4x
Then the conversation stopped, and I looked down at the ring  
Your folks were next to you, and you were right there next to me … And I said

Girl!  If you're wondering if I want you to (I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)

Whoa oh oh oh oh.

Girl!  If you're wondering if I want you to((I want you to) I want you to (I want you to)  
So make a move (Make ur movvvvve)  
'cause I ain't got all night  

### Bridge Harmony  8x
So much pain  
may come our way  
There may come a day  
when we have nothing left to say  

### Pre-chorus  4x  
When the conversation stops, and we're facing our defeat  
I'll be next to you and you'll be right there next to me … Then I'll say
