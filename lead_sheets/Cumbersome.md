# Cumbersome

She calls me Goliath and I wear the David mask  
I guess the stones are coming too fast for her now  
You know I'd like to believe this nervousness will pass  
All the stones that are thrown are building up a wall  
I have become cumbersome to this world  
I have become cumbersome to my girl  
I'd like to believe we could reconcile the past  
Resurrect those bridges with an ancient glance  
But my old stone face can't seem to break her down  
She remembers bridges, burns them to the ground  
I have become cumbersome to this world  
I have become cumbersome to my girl  
Too heavy too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right  
Today or tonight, cumbersome  
Too rich too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more  
The bitter taste is cumbersome  
No yeah  
No no no yeah  
No no no yeah  
There is a balance between two worlds  
One with an arrow and a cross  
Regardless of the balance life has become  
Cumbersome  
Too heavy too light, too black or too white, too wrong or too right  
Today or tonight, cumbersome  
Too rich too poor, she's wanting me less and I'm wanting her more  
The bitter taste is cumbersome  
No yeah  
No no no yeah  
No no no yeah  
Yeah yeah no no no yeah  
No life has been cumbersome
