Mary Had A Little Lamb   
Performed by Stevie Ray Vaughn   
May had a little lamb   
It's skin is black as the cool yeh   
Every where the child went   
The little lamb will surely go yeh   
He followed her to school one day   
And smoked the teacher's cool   
What a time did they had   
That day at the school yeh   
Kiss me, pass me baby   
I am dreaming yellow mask   
Wrote a letter to my baby   
On my way out Paskie   
Splits myself
