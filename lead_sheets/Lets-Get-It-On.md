### Verse  (Ellen) 8x
I've been really tryin', baby  
Tryin' to hold back this feeling for so long  
And if you feel like I feel, baby  
Then, c'mon, oh, c'mon

Don't you know how sweet and wonderful life can be  
I'm asking you baby to get it on with me

So c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby  
Stop beatin' 'round the bush

If you believe in love
